- Read about [[Design patterns]]  
	- from the book [(Dive into design patterns)](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns)
	- Watched  a [video](https://youtu.be/v9ejT8FO-7I) on the strategy pattern. This is a part of video series that is heavily inspired by Head Frst Design patterns book. This made me realise that there might be videos out there explaining entire books (technical) chapter-wise. And if so, this might be a better medium of consumption than reading a book (if the content creator does a great job!)
